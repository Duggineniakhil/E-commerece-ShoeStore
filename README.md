# E-commerece-ShoeStore
This is a front-end shoe e-commerce website called DAC Shoes - Step and Glide, designed and built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The website features a modern and responsive layout with a visually appealing homepage. 
It includes a hero section with a motivational tagline, navigation links to Products, Subscription, and Account pages, and call-to-action buttons like "Explore Collection" and "View Featured."

The purpose of this project is to practice front-end development and UI design by building a stylish and user-friendly landing page for a fictional shoe brand. 
The site works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices and is created with clean and organized code for easy editing and future improvements.

I also used a little bit of AI help for content ideas, layout suggestions, and to improve the writing in some parts. 
The design and code are completely written by me, but I used AI as a tool to support and speed up the process.
